# VisualizationForAll
This a Github repository for a project that would be beneficial to water engineers
# VisualizationForAll solution documentation
VisualizationForAll is a water management platform that analyses equipment used such as pipes while taking into account internal factors such as pressure surges in pipes as well as using external factors such as ground motion (earthquakes) or even high temperature from the environment.
Below is the solution architecture of the solution

# Alignment with the hackathon goal
Does the solution fit into the hackathon goal of designing, building and deploying a functional real world AI application using Microsoft fabric?
The solution aligns with the hackathon goal  as we are addressing a real world problem pertaining to enhancing operations of water  engineering companies and ensuring inclusive digital learning to people who are either  visually impaired or have limited knowledge of Information Technology.
The solution is an AI application which utilises Azure AI proxy playground especially GPT 4, so as to provide insights on performance of equipment used for water extraction such as pumps while using three-dimensional software.

Additionally, the  visualization we seek to acheive is also targeting water engineers who strain to understand how software such as how Microsoft Fabric works. We are using Auto Card (three-dimensional) software together with Azure AI proxy playground so as to design plastic braille material which is easier to visualise through touch rather than sight.
